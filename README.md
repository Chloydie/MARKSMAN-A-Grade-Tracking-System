# MARKSMAN-A-Grade-Tracking-System
A Digital Companion for Academic Achievement
Welcome to the MARKSMAN Web App! This folder contains all the necessary files and instructions needed to run the web app. 

Imports needed:
- Flask
- Sqlite3
- Plotly.express
- pandas
- base64
- io
- matplotlib.pyplot
- os

Please search on how to install and implement these individually. Make sure that it is working before you run app.py.

Lastly, install all the files in the repository in the same format, template and static folder with the python folder outside. When running correctly, a database file will be created, access this database using an external app like DB Browser.
